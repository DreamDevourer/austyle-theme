## Getting started
### To use version control in your project using GitHub and GitHub Actions:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the Austyle Theme repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your computer
2. [Set up GitHub secrets in your forked repository to encrypt sensitive information from showing publically](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) for `HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` and `HUBSPOT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_KEY`
3. Update the name of the directory that you'll be deploying to in your Design Manager in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file (the current default `dest_dir` is `austyle-theme`)
4. Deploy changes to your Design Manager by pushing to the `main` branch of your forked repository

Please reference the [_HubSpot CMS deploy GitHub action page_](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hubspot-cms-deploy) and _[Setting up continuous integration with a GitHub repository using GitHub Actions article](https://designers.hubspot.com/tutorials/github-integration)_ for more information.

## Getting Started
### Using the theme with the Source Code locally

1 - Make sure you have NPM installed on your OS, commonly Unix OSs like BSDs, Linux distros and MacOS already have NPM installed by default. On MS Windows use scoop or download directly from the source.

2 - After that run ``` npm install -g @hubspot/cli ``` to install HubSpot tools globally. You also can install to just the current directory with "npm install @hubspot/cli" but **it's not recommended**.

3 - Inside Austyle Theme directory run ```hs init``` and follow the steps.

4 - Finally upload the theme to your CMS with ```hs upload --account=<name> <src> <dest>``` (Example: ``` hs upload --account=123456789 . "/my themes folder" ```)
  
FOR UPDATING/UPGRADING - Use this command to update HubSpot Tools ``` npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest ```
  
FOR AUTOMATIC UPLOAD TO THE CMS - Watch your local directory and automatically upload changes to your HubSpot account on file saves with ``` hs watch --account=<name> <src> <dest> ```. Changes will be live immediately.
