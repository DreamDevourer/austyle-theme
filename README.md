## Getting started
### To use version control in your project using GitHub and GitHub Actions:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the Austyle Theme repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your computer
2. [Set up GitHub secrets in your forked repository to encrypt sensitive information from showing publically](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) for `HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` and `HUBSPOT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_KEY`
3. Update the name of the directory that you'll be deploying to in your Design Manager in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file (the current default `dest_dir` is `cms-theme-boilerplate`)
4. Deploy changes to your Design Manager by pushing to the `main` branch of your forked repository

Please reference the [_HubSpot CMS deploy GitHub action page_](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hubspot-cms-deploy) and _[Setting up continuous integration with a GitHub repository using GitHub Actions article](https://designers.hubspot.com/tutorials/github-integration)_ for more information.
